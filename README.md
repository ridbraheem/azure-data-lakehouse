# azure-data-lakehouse

In this project, we built a Data LakeHouse using Databricks and Azure Data Lake. Our approach involved the ELT methodology for the dataflows, with a strong focus on ensuring data security and privacy through the utilization of Unity Catalog and Azure Key Vault. We extracted data from Crunchbase’s API and performed light transformations by modeling it according to the medallion architecture. In a bid to enhance the depth and insight of our data, we delved into the capabilities of Langchain and OpenAI, and extracted valuable keywords that enrich the overall context. Here are some of the key achievements and activities undertaken in this project:

- Built a Data LakeHouse using Databricks and Azure Data Lake
- Created and Orchestrated Data Pipelines with Azure Data Factory and Databricks
- Implemented Data Governance and Data Security with Unity Catalog and Azure Key Vault
- Extracted Valuable Keywords from our data for further enrichment using Langchain and Open AI’s API
